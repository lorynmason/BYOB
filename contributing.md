# Colorado Brews Contribution Guide :beers:
:beer:Thank you for taking the time to contribute!:beer:

Welcome to Colorado Brews! The following is a set of guidelines for contributing
to the Colorado Brews API. They will equip you with the information needed to make the
most awesome contribution possible and will also make it as easy as possible for
us to help you get your code into production.

We respectfully remind you that we are all volunteers who maintain this project in our free time. We believe strongly in sometimes offering constructive and actionable feedback on pull requests, we will do our best to get back to asap, but don't hold your breath...

### Getting started
We maintain a list of open issues and have done our best to tag them, especially
the ones that might be good for first-time contributors. We suggest reviewing
that list, especially if you're not sure what to work on.

We also recommend reviewing the codebase to get a sense of overall project style
and how we like to test.

### Claim an issue
You may claim an issue by commenting on any open, unassigned issue. We may
respond by asking you to self-assign that issue, or we may ask you to pick a different issue. You are certainly welcome to simply begin working on something, but we may opt to not accept a pull request in the event of any parallel effort on that work.

Please do not add any new issues without first ensuring that the issue has not
already been entered.

### Submit a pull request
Before submitting a pull request, please take a few minutes to ensure that
you've considered the following:
- [ ] You've rebased the latest changes from master into your branch and
  addressed any merge conflicts (no merge commits, please).
- [ ] Commit messages follow the commit message template, found here:[template](https://github.com/lorynmason/BYOB/blob/master/commit_message_template.md) ,are descriptive and reflect what was changed.
- [ ] Pull request follow the pull request template found here: [template](https://github.com/lorynmason/BYOB/blob/master/pull_request_template.md), included a helpful description of your work in the pull request and
  have referenced any relevant issues.
- [ ] You've run the test suite and all tests are passing. **It is your
  responsibility to fix any tests that you break!** We will not merge any PR that
  breaks the test suite on CI.
- [ ] You've added any additional tests of your own, as needed, to cover new or
  changed functionality.

If you would like to open a pull request that is not yet ready for review,
please either indicate `WIP` in the title or the `WIP` label to signal that you are still working. Don't forget to
remove the `WIP` label when you feel that your code is ready for review.

Overall:

* Write tests
* Make sure the whole test suite is passing
* Keep your PR small, with a single focus
* Maintain a clean commit history
* Use a style consistent with the rest of the codebase
* Before submitting, rebase your work on the current master branch
